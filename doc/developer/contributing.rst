============

Contributions to **pypescript** are more than welcome!
Please follow these guidelines before filing a pull request:

* Please abide by `PEP8`_ as much as possible in your code writing, add docstrings and tests for each new functionality.

* Check your changes did not add too many code issues. Run `prospector`_ in :root:`Root directory`. This will be run by `Codacy`_ after pushing to GitHub.

* Check documentation compiles, with the expected result; see :ref:`developer-documentation`.

* Submit your pull request.
