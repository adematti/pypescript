                  :class:`BaseLikelihood` extends :class:`~pypescript.BasePipeline`, to e.g. setup data and execute model.
                  Data vector data.y is set in the setup step.

                  The model model.y is read at each execute step and the corresponding likelihood.loglkl computed.
