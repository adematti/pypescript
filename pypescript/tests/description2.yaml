long description: >
                  :class:`BaseLikelihood` extends :class:`~pypescript.BasePipeline`, hence is expected to run several modules to e.g. setup data and execute model.
                  Data vector data.y is set in the setup step.

                  The model model.y is read at each execute step and the corresponding likelihood.loglkl computed.

setup input:
  data.y:
    type: float_array
    description: data vector

execute input:
  model.y:
    type: float_array
    description: model vector

execute output:
  likelihood.loglkl:
    type: float
    description: log-likelihood
