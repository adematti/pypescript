# pypescript

**pypescript** is a Python framework to script pipelines putting together code pieces called *modules* in interaction through
a data container called *data_block*.
**pypescript** provides utilities to compile C/C++/Fortran modules into Python modules.
It is inspired by the cosmological inference code [CosmoSIS](https://bitbucket.org/joezuntz/cosmosis/src/master/) used by the DES collaboration.
